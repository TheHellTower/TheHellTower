Dear supporters,

I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your ongoing generosity and support. Your donations can make a tremendous difference in my ability to help to continue our work and achieve our goals.

I know that not everyone is in a position to make a donation at this time or not at teh same level, but I appreciate your support in other ways, such as spreading the word about our cause or volunteering your time.

I also want to let you know that I'm considering creating a donators leaderboard in the next months to recognize and thank our supporters.

Optionally, If I'm able to collect enough funds, I will be able to make donations to important causes and make a significant and sustained impact on these causes over time. (All donations would be fully recorded and posted.)

Once again, thank you for your support. It means the world to me and helps me to make a positive impact in the world. I will probably keep you updated on my progress and look forward to sharing more about our work with you soon.

Sincerely,

`TheHellTower`.
